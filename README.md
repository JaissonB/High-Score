# High Score
- This is a project developed at autumn course of URI college and then improved by me.

## `API`
- The more easy mode to use the API was using the Mockoon software, to use it, it's just do the download at <a href="https://mockoon.com/download/">Oficial website</a>. After open file "high-score.json" into Mockoon, in 'File' -> 'Open environment' -> select the high-score.json file. To init the localhost just click on 'Start server',  green button on upper left corner.

## `Start`
- To init the application, first clone this reposity and execute 'npm install' after 'npm start'.
- To no need modify the code, the API must be on the port 3001 and the application on port 3000 of localhost.
